I used ChatGPT-5 to generate the website, and below is the prompt I used:
"I want to create and edit my personal website using Markdown. I have already created a repository for it using GitHub: https://sanakhatib4.github.io/. i want to edit the website to make it look more proffessional, to include a link to my weizmann profile and lab (which i will provide later), and i want the theme to be based on a pastel color palette of pink, blu,e and purple, cute cats and molecules, with a minimalist appearance.

It generated the Markdown code and I just copied and pasted it into my README.md file.
