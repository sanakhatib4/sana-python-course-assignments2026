I used ChatGPT-5 (linked to VS Code editor) to help me with this assignment & I used the following prompts:

1. Help me build a GUI function using Tk library that takes dates as input and outputs the corresponding zodiac sign.

2. Change the background from basic white to a starry night themed background

3. Upgrade the function to make it output the moon sign and rising as well, not only the sun sign

Then I adjusted the text details on my own.
